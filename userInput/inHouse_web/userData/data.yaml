          <p style='margin-top:0'>Not too long ago I heard one of my favorite leaders say these words: “Direction, not intention, determines your destination”. That stuck with me. I don’t know about you but seems daily I battle keeping my mind and feet on a path toward productivity vs just activity. You may have heard me say in past 
          newsletters that<b> Your Routine = Your Results.</b> For me to ensure the right direction of being productive and valuing others each day I need to examine my habits. As you know, we can create and establish effective and productive habits but also develop bad habits. </p> 
          <p>So, as I began working on <b>HOW to better help myself, my team and you </b>as we head in to a new year, I began by looking at MY habits. It is amazing how you can start out with a great routine of good habits but over time - drift. To hedge against that, I looked back at the habits of the most effective people. </p>
          <p>You may or may not have ever read Stephen Covey’s best-selling book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, if not, you should get a copy and read it. If you have, it could be time for a refresher… depending on whether you are happy with your direction or concerned your current path may not 100% end at your desired destination in life.</p>
          <p>In the book, Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls "true north" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless. </p>
          <p>Most people believe they have good ethics, but again, if the outcomes or results we are getting from our daily routines are NOT what we want… we must realize something isn’t quite right. How effective are you at obtaining desired results? </p>
          <p>Effectiveness is the <b>balance</b> of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results. Covey illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results. </p>
          <p>Covey promotes what he labels "the character ethic": aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles. In doing this, Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values. He sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. <b>Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences.</b> To better demonstrate this, Mr. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence through independence on to interdependence. Bottom line… Daily habits that = desired results and then some. </p>
